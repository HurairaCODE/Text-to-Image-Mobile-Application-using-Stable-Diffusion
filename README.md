# Text-to-Image-Mobile-Application-using-Stable-Diffusion

This is a mobile application which is an api call to stable diffusion api, it creates images from text prompt. 
I took the basic functionality from the repository https://github.com/Everyday-Programmer/Ai-Image-Generator-Android (All credits to this repo)


To use this repo, create a account on https://stablediffusionapi.com/ and generate your API key and enter in ImageGenerator.java file in the line number 35 
String key = "Enter your API key here";
